INSTRUCTIONS
Please read the instructions carefully before doing the questions.
•	You are NOT allowed to use any other materials. You are NOT allowed to use any device to share data with others.
•	You must use IDE as Visual Studio 2019 or later, MSSQL Server 2016 or later database for your development tools.  
IMPORTANT – Before you start doing your solution, MUST do the following steps:
1.	To do your program, you must use Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), apply 3-Layer architecture, there are at least 2 Projects for the Solution. The database connection string must get from appsettings.json file. 
In the case your program connects directly to database from WPF Windows/Pages or you hardcode connection string, you will get 0 point.
2.	Create Solution in Visual Studio 2019/2022 named PE_PRN212_SP25_TrialTest_StudentName.  Inside the Solution, Project WPF named: PerfumeManagement_StudentCode.
3.	Create your MS SQL database named Sp25PerfumeStoreDB by running code in script Sp25PerfumeStoreDB.sql. 
4.	Set the default user interface for your project as Login window/page.
5.	If there are syntax errors or compilation errors in your PE program, you will not pass the PE requirements, the point will be 0.
6.	Your work will be considered invalid (0 point) if your code inserts stuff that is unrelated to the test.


Create an application using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) with .NET5/.NET6/.NET7/.NET8, C#, and Entity Framework Core. A MS SQL Server database will be created to persist the data and it will be used for reading and managing data.
The below Figure is a part of Sp25PerfumeStoreDB database.
